# Player! V1.31

Player! is a five button macropad originally designed to accomodate changing music settings in Spotify without tabbing into the Spotify client. By default it is programmed to use dedicated media keys, which can be further optimised with global hotkeys using [Toastify](https://github.com/aleab/toastify) or [Volumey](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/volumey/9MZCQ03MX0S3?hl=en-gb&gl=gb&rtc=1).

Using four cherry compatible switches, Player! provides dedicated keys for pausing/playing music -  returning to a previous song, and skipping to the next song. The fourth switch remains user programmable, binded to 'insert' by default to be used as dedicated Discord mute key. A rotary encoder allows for volume control, with a toggle function bound to its embedded switch to allow rotary control of rewinding and fast-forwarding music. Player! is entirely customisable, using [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) for rebinding keys.

V1.31 has made the Player! bigger to accommodate 4 mounting holes, which will be used to mount the PCB to a case. The otherwise empty space is covered in a tropical leaf pattern on the top copper layer; a number of changes have been made to improve the appearance and the fit/function of the base.
